	This is a list of kamatz katans in the Torah.  The list was generated using a Python script from the "Miqra According to the Masora" project.  While it was reviewed and checked manually, the checking process was not very in-depth, and it likely contains errors.  Please report errors found by submitting an issue report in the github repo here: \url{https://github.com/nkasimer/kamatz-katan-list/issues}
	
	The various forms of the word \hebword{כל} have not been included because of how common the word is.  Special mention should be made, however, of Isaiah 40:12, where the word \hebword{כל} has a kamatz gadol and is a verb.
	
	Words where reading traditions vary have been noted.  Generally these are words where a kamatz is followed by a gutteral consonant which is followed by a chataf-kamatz.  Sephardim, following the Radak, pronounce these as kamatz gadol. Others read it as a Kamatz Katan.
	
	This is designed as a quick reference guide.  The book "The Ohs and Ahs of Torah Reading" by Rivka Sherman-Gold has a similar guide which inspired this one.  While that text is extremely helpful, both in its reference guide and its explanation of the rules for kamatz-types, it is out-of-print and difficult to find. This is intended to fill the gap, in part, from the difficulty in finding it.
